1. `Please provide the sample images of the objects. Object will be of max l*b*h = 40*40*20 cms and min 3*3*3  cms`
2. Please specify the exact scoring formula i.e. the order of importance of the heuristics we are asked to minimize . TBA EOD
3. Please provide us with a sample tour . No , we will provide the output format shortly 
4. `Please provide us information regarding the bag sizes, EDD of the SKUs, slots for pickups, warehouse location and number of riders and their respective bag sizes. Do not need to worry of pickup slots , assume one pickup slot at 9am , you need to route for dispatch .  Rider bag dimensions are : 60*60*100 cms , 80*80*100 cms` 
5. Is the ordering in bag a hard constraint that we have to follow or just another constraint which we can oversee if we are somehow improving another heuristic at the cost of degrading this one. Riderbag ordering is a hard constraint , given it reduces the time for delivery for the last mile rider as less time spend to search consignment. 
6. Are we allowed access to the drivers current location based on the location of the phone on which the application is running"


- What is the desired output for the given input file?  :TBA EOD
- How are dynamic points accounted for?  :  10 percent max dynamic points to be added 
- How many drivers would be there in the journey?  # riders =.   In range of [(#inital_shipments_to_deliver / 20) , (#inital_shipments_to_deliver / 30)] 
- To what degree of accuracy we can expect the addresses to be? Address are to be assumed accurate , the accuracy of geolocation depends on the geolocation service you are using 
- What is the estimated area which you will be covering in view of addresses, like how much area accounts for ""Bangalore"", because that will decide how large of a map we'd be using inside our application?
